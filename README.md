Hi, I'm William! I love building little web tools to make my life easier. I keep things simple with Python and hypermedia. I also like to package useful tools into container images.

Here are a few open source projects that I use and that have accepted my contributions:

- [htmx](https://htmx.org): I added meta descriptions to many pages on the official website so when someone posts a link in Discord or social media, you get a useful description.
- [htpy](https://htpy.dev): I improved parsing id/class CSS selector strings to remove unnecessary whitespace.

Do you have a question about one of my archived repositories? [Open an issue on my personal repository][x] and we can talk about it.
